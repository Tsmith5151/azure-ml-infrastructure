## Azure Infrastructure as Code for Machine Learning

- This repository contains IaC for Machine Learning Task in Azure using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). The objective is to expand this repository over time to contain examples of spinning up core Machine Learning infrastructure components for Data Scientist. 


## Getting Started

There are several requirements needed to get started. First, you'll need to create an Azure account and subscription if you do not have one. We will be using Azure Command Line functionality so you'll need to install AZ CLI as well. Next, terraform will need to be installed and also an IDE (if preferred).

**Login to Azure**

Login to your Azure account and set to the correct subscription:
```
az login
az account set --subscription <enter-subscription-id>
```
